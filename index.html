        <p><em>Author of <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UIQW58Q#reader_B00UIQW58Q" target="_blank">Air Purifiers Exposed</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I am a AADP Certified Health Coach with a diploma in Colour Therapy and a disabled veteran. . I am passionate about my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and helping people. I have dealt with a personal disability that has wreaked havoc on my
          nervous
          system for years but by the grace of God and learning about the body I have done a good job of weaning myself from medication and learning to thrive amidst the limitations that it brings me. It is for this reason that I have learned how to
          improve my condition as well as many things in general about good health and wellbeing. My drive is to allow God to use my life to teach, inspire and help people improve their health. I look forward to doing all those things sprinkled with
          some
          entertainment through writing quality books that will accomplish each of those passions.
